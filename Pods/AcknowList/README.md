# AcknowList

_Ready to use “Acknowledgements”/“Licenses”/“Credits” view controller for [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/)._

_Written in Swift 5 (for Objective-C, you can use [VTAcknowledgementsViewController](https://github.com/vtourraine/VTAcknowledgementsViewController))._

## How to Install

This project is only useful if you use CocoaPods, so let’s assume that you’re indeed using CocoaPods.

1. Add `pod 'AcknowList'` in your `Podfile`.
2. Run `pod install`.
3. Add the `Pods-{target}-acknowledgements.plist` file generated by CocoaPods in `Pods/Target Support Files/Pods-{target}/` to your main target (drag and drop the file in your Xcode project). Don’t copy the file, leave `Copy items if needed` unchecked.


## How to Use

The `AcknowListViewController` instance is usually pushed to an existing `UINavigationController`.

``` swift
let viewController = AcknowListViewController()
navigationController?.pushViewController(viewController, animated: true)
```


## Customization

If your `.plist` file is named something other than `Pods-acknowledgements.plist` (_e.g._ if you’re using custom build targets), you can initialize the view controller with a custom path.

``` swift
let viewController = AcknowListViewController(fileNamed: "Pods-AcknowExample-acknowledgements")
```

``` swift
let path = Bundle.main.path(forResource: "Pods-AcknowExample-acknowledgements", ofType: "plist")
let viewController = AcknowListViewController(acknowledgementsPlistPath: path)
```

## Apple TV

AcknowList is also compatible with tvOS for Apple TV apps.
